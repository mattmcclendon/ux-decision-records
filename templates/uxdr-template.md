# UXDR-XXX: <Decision Title>

## Decision
A clear, single-sentence statement of the decision that was made.

This should describe what changed, was selected, or was committed to.

## Context
The circumstances that required a decision.

Include:
- system or product scope
- user populations affected
- organizational, policy, or technical constraints
- time pressure or external drivers, if relevant

Avoid hindsight. Write as the decision looked at the time.

## Problem Statement
What problem this decision attempted to address.

Frame the problem in human and system terms, not feature gaps.

## Options Considered
A concise list of alternatives that were genuinely considered.

For each option:
- describe the approach
- note the primary benefit
- note the primary risk or limitation

Options that were dismissed quickly should still be listed.

## Decision Rationale
Why this option was selected over the alternatives.

This section should explicitly name:
- tradeoffs accepted
- values prioritized
- risks deferred or absorbed

Judgment belongs here.

## Expected Impact
Anticipated effects on:
- users
- system behavior
- trust, equity, or accessibility
- operational or maintenance burden

This is a forward-looking statement, not a success claim.

## Risks and Mitigations
Known risks introduced by this decision and how they were mitigated, monitored, or consciously accepted.

## Review and Revisit Criteria
Conditions under which this decision should be revisited.

Examples:
- new data availability
- policy changes
- scale thresholds
- user harm indicators

## Status
Proposed / Accepted / Deprecated

## Date
YYYY-MM-DD
