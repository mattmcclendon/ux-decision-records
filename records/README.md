# UX Decision Records

This directory contains UX Decision Records (UXDRs), each documenting a consequential design or system decision.

Records are written at the moment judgment is exercised, not after outcomes are known.

## Index

- **UXDR-001** — Documenting UX Decisions Explicitly  
  Establishes a formal decision record process to preserve context and intent.

- **UXDR-002** — Preserving Human Judgment by Not Automating  
  Defines when automation undermines trust and legitimacy.

## How to Read These Records
Each UXDR captures:
- the decision
- the context in which it was made
- the alternatives considered
- the rationale behind the final choice

Records are not endorsements of outcomes. They are artifacts of reasoning.

## Contribution Discipline
Records are added selectively. Not every decision warrants documentation.

If everything is recorded, nothing is legible.
